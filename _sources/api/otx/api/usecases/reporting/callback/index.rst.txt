.. py:class:: Callback

   Abstract base class used to build new callbacks.

   Properties
       params: dict. Training parameters
           (eg. verbosity, batch size, number of epochs...).
       model: instance of `keras.models.Model`.
           Reference of the model being trained.

   The `logs` dictionary that callback methods
   take as argument will contain keys for quantities relevant to
   the current batch or epoch.

   Currently, the `.fit()` method of the `Sequential` model class
   will include the following quantities in the `logs` that
   it passes to its callbacks:

       on_epoch_end: logs include `acc` and `loss`, and
           optionally include `val_loss`
           (if validation is enabled in `fit`), and `val_acc`
           (if validation and accuracy monitoring are enabled).
       on_batch_begin: logs include `size`,
           the number of samples in the current batch.
       on_batch_end: logs include `loss`, and optionally `acc`
           (if accuracy monitoring is enabled).
